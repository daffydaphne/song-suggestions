Hello, dear reader! Daffy Daphne Daff Daffo here, on the other side of this little interaction, currently writing the first post of the Songs Suggestions by Daff et al. As you might be able to tell (hopefully I've added some visual aids by the time you're reading this), this post is part of the _Albums and Bands_ collection.
So what are these "collections", you might ask? Basically I'm thinking about creating three types of posts:

- Albums and Bands - Posts discussing certain albums or bands, such as this one, where I'll talk about albums that for various reasons linger in my mind.
- Vibes - Posts with a collection of songs that I feel fit a certain vibe, such as _late afternoon at the park_ or _driving alone: upbeat or melancholy editions_.
- Others - Posts just sharing other random stuff, probably a mix of various topics, such as thoughts about life, movie, book, TV show opinions or just other interests that I might want to write about. These might have their own categories.

Now that we've at least lightly introduced the concept, let's dive into the first album I want to talk about, shall we?

## The Story

Here you are, a young(er) Daff. You get a lot of your new music from those song session videos, sometimes from radios, other times from youtube channels such as [Mahogany Sessions](https://www.youtube.com/@MahoganySessions), where artists are invited to sing their songs or versions of some other favorite tunes. About 9 years ago on [triple j](https://www.youtube.com/@triplej) this Australian bandâ€”triple j is an Australian national radio stationâ€” came in to the Like a Version sessions and performed [All My Friends](https://youtu.be/uBx-Zz7CAOc) by LCD Soundsystem. And so Daff was hooked. The rawness of the vocals and the contained power that the overall compressed sound of the band conveyed was somehow a dichotomy that made sense. It was as if they were intentionally caging their sound, like a boxer holding punches, afraid of what he might unleash if he just went all out. Even so, there was something missing from their music.

And so, when in February 2017 they released _What Can I Do If the Fire Goes Out?_ as the single for the new album, it is not an exaggeration to say I was very excited for the album release in August! So what happened? Surely August came and I enjoyed a great album filled with beautiful recollections of and reflexions on life experiences, proped up by a powerful arrangements and orchestrations! Well, I remember this album for three main reasons my dear reader. The first one is that the album was only officially released on October 20th where I live, 2 months after the initial release date. The second one is that I think the album is truly beautiful, even though it's not the greatest sounding or more ambitious. The third one is that i clearly remember the day I finally got to listen to the album for the first time. I was dating a girl at the time who studied and lived in a city about 1h30m away by train. It was a friday, and I finished my classes and ran straight to the train station, cause I was gonna visit for the weekend. It was raining, raining pretty hard. My girlfriend was going to be busy prepping some college activities for the next day, so we spent our little time we had getting back to her house, making dinner, which she very promptly ate before leaving and I was left at her house with some of her roommates. And so I cleaned the dishes, she had some laundry finishing so i went up and started hanging it (no dryers here dear americans ðŸ˜¥). It took me more than one hour to hang the clothesâ€”I swear I'm usually way more productive of a maid. I caught myself just holding socks for the whole duration of songs. I just couldn't believe David Le'aupepe was actually living up to my expectations. A man so damaged, who'd been so broken down by life, putting it all out there once again for the world to admit defeat despite what it made him go through. He [perservered](https://open.spotify.com/track/33w7gsiejX0eGoDIRFdYu4) and made me believe it was possible for me to do so aswell.

Daffy.

P.S.: It's late and I didn't review this so excuse any errors or unfinished thoughts, I'll fix it later but wanted to post something.
