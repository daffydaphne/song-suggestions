Breaking News! The first _Vibes_ post is here and I'm ready to either induce a mood, help paint a atmosphere or simply share some songs with you! Come check these tunes that definitely all fit a certain vibe (results may vary, I am not liable for any divergent opinions and sensations).

As might be the case with all the first posts of their kind in this post, I don't have a good idea as to how or what I'll write. Should I just link a bunch of songs and tell you to dim the lights or open the curtains, lie down or get up and move your body? Guess we'll find out eventually. Also should I make a playlist in some streaming service or just share the links here? <span style='font-size: 12px'>_choices choices choices_</span> For now here's a link to a tiny spotify playlist.

Today the _vibe_ is staying at home on a not so hot summer day, but still hot enough that staying inside in the shade still has a bigger pull on you. I'd say most of the songs here are quite chillâ€”soft voices, moderate bpms, no harsh instrument sounds. To my ears and brain they help set a relaxed ambiance but not an overly languid one. You can still feel life, blood pumping inside and a desire to execute small movements, like alternating shoulder shrugs to the beat of the songs accompanied by little head bobs.

Yes I drew the little drawings that are on posts now. Another silly little thing you may find amusig and will hopefully help breaking up the walls of text. They will eventually fit better on the page but for now they serve their purpose as best they can. Hope you have beautiful afternoon/night/morning wherever you are in this big world and that reading this post and listening to the songs may help you relax and take your mind wandering for a bit in fields of tall grass that's cold to the touch.
